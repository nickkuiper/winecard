# Wine Card

Welcome to the Wine Card project! This web application displays a selection of wines, categorized by style, and allows users to filter the list interactively. 

## Features

- Fetches wine data from an external JSON file.
- Categorizes wines into different types (e.g., Beer, Bubbles, White, Red, Dessert).
- Dynamically displays wines sorted by country and style.
- Interactive filter buttons to narrow down wine selections.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file providing the structure of the web application.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet containing styles for layout, fonts, and aesthetics.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles data fetching, processing, and dynamic content rendering.

## File Descriptions

### `index.html`

This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the wine selection display. It includes:

- A header with the title “TOETSENBORDPAD 33” and subtitle “WIJN SELECTIE”.
- A section where the wine categories and selections will be displayed.
- References to the CSS styles and JavaScript functionality.

### `style.css`

This file handles the styling of the application, including:

- General styles such as body background color and fonts.
- Header and section styles that enhance readability.
- Styles for the wine list, ensuring a well-organized presentation.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Print styles for optimal printing quality.

### `script.js`

The JavaScript file is responsible for the following functionalities:

- Fetching wine data from a Google Cloud Storage link in JSON format.
- Processing the fetched data to categorize the wines based on their styles.
- Dynamically creating and displaying sections for each wine style.
- Implementing filtering functionality, allowing users to view wines by specific styles.
- Handling errors and displaying an appropriate message if the data fails to load.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. You will see a list of wine categories and can filter the wines using the provided buttons.
3. Click on any button to view wines of a specific style or select "all" to view the complete list.
